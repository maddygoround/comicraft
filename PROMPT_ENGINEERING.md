# Comic Panel Generation - Prompt Engineering Guide

## Overview

The comic panel generation system uses a **simplified, direct prompting approach** to ensure generated images accurately follow the script and dialogue. Less is more - we focus on clear communication of the scene, characters, and emotional context without overcomplicating the prompt.

## Problem Statement

### Previous Issues
1. **Generic Images**: Generated panels were too lazy and didn't match dialogue
2. **Lack of Emotion**: Characters showed neutral expressions despite intense dialogue
3. **Static Poses**: Characters stood idle instead of performing actions
4. **Poor Visual Storytelling**: Images didn't convey the narrative moment

### Solution
Implemented a **simple, natural language prompt** that:
- Clearly states the scene and what's happening
- Includes dialogue for emotional context
- Gives key instructions without overwhelming the AI
- Lets Gemini's intelligence handle the visual interpretation

## Simplified Prompt Structure (Current)

The prompt is now natural and conversational, focusing on what matters:

```
Create a single comic book panel in "{style}" style with a "{palette}" color palette.

THE SCENE: {narration}

CHARACTERS PRESENT: {character names}

WHAT'S HAPPENING: {Character} is saying: "{dialogue}". {Character} is saying: "{dialogue}".

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Show the exact moment described in the scene
- Characters' facial expressions and body language MUST match what they're saying and feeling
- Make the action dynamic and expressive - NO static poses
- Characters should be actively interacting with each other or reacting to the situation
- Use the provided character reference images to maintain their appearance
- DO NOT add speech bubbles, text, or captions to the image
- Make it visually dramatic and engaging like a professional comic book panel

Style it with {border} borders and create strong visual storytelling through composition, lighting, and character acting.
```

**Why this works**:
- Natural language that's easy for AI to understand
- Dialogue provides emotional context automatically
- Focus on the essentials without micromanaging
- Lets Gemini's visual intelligence shine

## Philosophy: Less is More

### What We Learned

**Initial Approach** (Overcomplicated):
- ❌ Tried to specify every detail (pose angles, emotion percentages, camera setups)
- ❌ Added complex inference systems for lighting, backgrounds, angles
- ❌ Used rigid structured formats with many ❗ markers
- ❌ Result: AI got confused by too many instructions

**Current Approach** (Simplified):
- ✅ State the scene clearly and naturally
- ✅ Include dialogue for emotional context
- ✅ Give essential instructions only
- ✅ Trust Gemini's visual intelligence
- ✅ Result: Better storytelling, more natural images

### Key Insight

**Gemini is already smart about visual storytelling.** When you say:
- "Character is saying: 'I can't believe you did this!'"
- Gemini understands: anger, frustration, accusatory body language, emotional intensity

You don't need to spell out:
- "emotion: anger – 85%"
- "pose: pointing finger forward, body angled aggressively"
- "camera: low-angle with Dutch tilt"

The dialogue itself carries the emotional weight.

## How It Works Now

### 2. Panel Style & Mood

```
style: "{style}" art style with strong visual storytelling
palette: "{palette}" color palette
border style: {border} panel borders
mood lighting: [INFERRED from narration]
```

**Inference**: Lighting is automatically determined from scene context (dark/bright/tense/warm).

### 3. Story Snapshot (One Moment in Time)

```
❗scene summary: [narration]
camera framing: [INFERRED]
camera distance: [INFERRED]
camera angle: [INFERRED]
composition: [INFERRED]
background: [INFERRED]
```

**Key Principle**: Each panel captures ONE freeze-frame moment, preventing action blur.

### 4. Character Specifications

For each character:
```
• Character: {name}
  - Current pose: [INFERRED from dialogue + narration]
  - Facial emotion: [INFERRED with intensity %]
  - Action: [INFERRED specific action]
```

**Critical**: Each character gets explicit pose instructions to avoid static defaults.

### 5. Emotional Beat

```
❗EMOTIONAL BEAT (drives character acting):
Character: "exact dialogue line"
```

**Purpose**: Dialogue drives facial expressions and body language without appearing in artwork.

### 6. Visual Requirements (Hard Constraints)

```
❗Show action-driven poses matching dialogue
❗Facial expressions reflect emotional intensity
❗Dynamic body language tells the story
❗Characters interact, NOT standing static
❗Maintain character likeness from references
```

### 7. Optional Style Enhancers

```
+ Dynamic motion lines if action is intense
+ Dramatic shadows and highlights
+ Cinematic depth of field
+ Comic book visual effects
```

**Soft requirements** that enhance without overriding story facts.

## Intelligent Inference System

### Emotion Inference (`inferEmotionFromDialogue`)

Analyzes dialogue text patterns to determine emotions with intensity:

| Pattern | Emotion | Intensity |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `!!`, `damn`, `hell` | Anger | 85% |
| `!?`, `what?`, `why?` | Frustration | 70% |
| `?!`, `oh no`, `help` | Fear | 80% |
| `what?`, `really?` | Shock | 75% |
| `ha!`, `yes!`, `great` | Joy | 80% |
| `sorry`, `tears`, `sad` | Sadness | 75% |
| `will`, `must`, `never` | Determination | 80% |
| `smirk`, `oh really` | Sarcasm | 60% |

**Examples**:
- "I can't believe you did this!" → `frustration – 70%`
- "What?! No way!" → `shock – 75%`
- "Yes! We did it!" → `joy – 80%`

### Pose Inference (`inferPoseFromContext`)

Determines character body positions based on action keywords:

| Context | Pose |
|---------|------|
| `punch`, `hit`, `strike` | "mid-punch with torso twisted, fist forward" |
| `run`, `chase`, `escape` | "dynamic running pose, body leaned forward" |
| `point`, `accuse` | "pointing finger forward, body angled aggressively" |
| `cry`, `tears` | "hunched shoulders, hands covering face" |
| `yell`, `shout` | "leaning forward, mouth open wide, gesturing" |
| `think`, `wonder` | "hand on chin, thoughtful stance" |
| `confront`, `stand` | "standing firm, hands on hips or arms crossed" |

**Default**: "natural standing pose with slight body turn for dynamism"

### Camera Setup Inference (`determineCameraSetup`)

Automatically determines cinematic camera positioning:

#### Framing & Distance
- **Close-up**: When narration mentions `close`, `face`, `eyes`, `expression`
- **Wide shot**: For `action`, `fight`, `battle`, `intense`
- **Group shot**: When 3+ characters present
- **Two-shot**: For `intimate`, `whisper`, `secret`

#### Angle
- **Low-angle (heroic)**: For `powerful`, `dominant`, `strong`, `tower`
- **High-angle (vulnerable)**: For `weak`, `defeated`, `small`, `vulnerable`
- **Dutch tilt**: For `intense`, `dramatic`, `tension`
- **Over-the-shoulder**: For `confront`, `face-to-face`

#### Composition
- **Centered with diagonals**: Single character scenes
- **Split composition**: Opposition/confrontation scenes
- **Foreground-background depth**: Discovery/reveal moments
- **Rule of thirds**: Default for dynamic flow

### Lighting Inference (`inferLighting`)

Determines mood lighting automatically:

| Scene Context | Lighting |
|---------------|----------|
| `night`, `dark`, `shadow` | Dramatic high-contrast with deep shadows |
| `day`, `bright`, `sun` | Bright natural lighting with soft shadows |
| `tense`, `danger`, `scary` | Ominous rim lighting from behind |
| `warm`, `cozy`, `safe` | Warm golden-hour lighting |
| `cold`, `alone`, `empty` | Cool blue lighting with harsh contrasts |
| `dramatic`, `intense`, `climax` | Dramatic side lighting with strong shadows |

### Background Inference (`inferBackground`)

Context-appropriate settings:

| Keywords | Background |
|----------|------------|
| `street`, `city`, `urban` | Urban street setting with buildings |
| `room`, `inside`, `indoor` | Interior room with furniture and walls |
| `forest`, `trees`, `nature` | Natural forest environment |
| `fight`, `battle`, `combat` | Dynamic action environment with debris |
| `empty`, `void`, `alone` | Minimalist background focusing on character |

## Best Practices

### 1. Write Clear Narration
✅ Good: "Sarah punches the villain in a dark alley"
❌ Bad: "Sarah does something"

The system infers better from specific action verbs.

### 2. Make Dialogue Expressive
✅ Good: "I can't believe you betrayed me!"
❌ Bad: "You betrayed me."

Punctuation and word choice drive emotion intensity.

### 3. Include Context in Narration
✅ Good: "A tense confrontation in the rain-soaked street"
❌ Bad: "They talk"

Descriptive narration helps with lighting, background, and mood.

### 4. Use Action Verbs
✅ Good: "runs", "punches", "cries", "points"
❌ Bad: "is", "has", "goes"

Action verbs trigger specific pose inference.

### 5. Specify Setting Details
✅ Good: "inside the dark warehouse"
❌ Bad: "somewhere"

Setting keywords trigger appropriate backgrounds and lighting.

## Example Transformation

### Before (Generic Prompt)
```
Generate a comic panel in Comic Book style.
Scene: Hero confronts villain.
Characters: Hero, Villain.
Hero says: "It's over!"
Show characters interacting.
```

**Result**: Static characters, neutral faces, generic standing poses.

### After (Improved Prompt)
```
❗Render a SINGLE, borderless comic panel
style: "Comic Book" art style with strong visual storytelling
palette: "Vibrant" color palette
mood lighting: dramatic side lighting with strong shadows

❗scene summary: Hero confronts villain in dark warehouse
camera framing: medium shot
camera distance: medium
camera angle: slight Dutch tilt for tension
composition: split composition with characters on opposite sides
background: dynamic action environment with debris

• Character: Hero
  - Current pose: pointing finger forward, body angled aggressively
  - Facial emotion: determination – 80%
  - Action: pointing accusingly

• Character: Villain
  - Current pose: standing firm, hands on hips or arms crossed
  - Facial emotion: confidence – 70%
  - Action: taking defensive position

❗EMOTIONAL BEAT:
Hero: "It's over!"

❗Show action-driven poses matching dialogue
❗Facial expressions reflect emotional intensity
❗Dynamic body language tells the story
```

**Result**: Hero dramatically pointing with determined expression, Villain in defensive stance with confident smirk, dynamic camera angle, dramatic lighting, clear emotional conflict.
